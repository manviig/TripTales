For example, it is polite to greet people with a handshake, and to use "signore" (for men) or "signora" (for women) when addressing someone you don't know well. Italians are also quite passionate about their food, so it is considered rude to leave food on your plate or to ask for a doggy bag. Overall, the best advice is to be respectful and to use common sense when interacting with locals.
